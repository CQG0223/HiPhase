# HiPhase: Deep absolute phase recovery from single-frequency phase map for handheld 3D measurement

• Absolute fringe-order is retrieved from one FPP phase map by the DCNN.

• The DCNN is lightweight and operates in real-time for a phase-map of 1024×1024 pixels on a GTX 1660Ti.

• A large-scale and challenging phase unwrapping dataset is built from real objects and publicly available.

Code and dataset will be available soon.
